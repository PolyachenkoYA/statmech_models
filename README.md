# statmech_models
A number of statmech problems/systems implemented via MC simulations during a grad course

C_py_arrays, compilation, test_limit, cython_quad, gsl_rnd: minimal examples for C/CPP and pybind11 Python+CPP interface, gsl random generation (better for Sci computing)

Izing: The 2D Ising model

harmonic: quantum MC for a 1D wave-function in a harmonic potential

percolation: 2D lattice percolation simulations (finding the percolation threshold)

polymer: MC for polymers with self-repulsion

soft_spheres: EOS for LJ spheres
